## P0 - Critical Issues

_Issues that break core functionality. Must fix immediately._

### Bugs

- **Non-Apple Music sources not updating UI**: Transport state updates work for Apple Music and most streaming services, but certain sources (e.g., Beats 1 radio, possibly other radio stations) don't trigger UI metadata updates. Core play/pause state changes work, but track/station information doesn't refresh. May be related to different metadata formats or missing fields in non-music-streaming content. (MenuBarContentView.swift, SonosController.swift) [Added 2025-10-04]

### UX Critical

### Architecture Critical

## P1 - High Priority

_Major friction points impacting usability, significant missing features, or important architectural issues._

### Features
- **Intelligent audio source selection when grouping**: When grouping speakers, automatically select the most appropriate audio source rather than arbitrary coordinator selection. Inspired by Sonos physical button UX: actively playing audio should take precedence over paused/idle speakers. For example, when grouping two stereo pairs where one is playing and one is paused, the playing audio should automatically become the group's source. Enhance grouping flow to detect what's currently playing across selected speakers and intelligently choose coordinator to preserve active playback. Consider showing user a preview/confirmation when multiple speakers are playing different content ("Join [Speaker A] playing [Song]?" vs "Make [Speaker B] the leader?"). This would capture the essence of Sonos's beloved physical interaction model in the digital UI. [Added 2025-10-04]

- **Trigger device cache management**: Add ability to refresh trigger sources and cache them persistently. Users should be able to manually delete cached devices that are no longer relevant (similar to WiFi network history - devices remain in cache even when not currently available, but can be manually removed).

- **Merge multiple groups**: Allow merging two or more existing groups into a single larger group. Currently can only create new groups from ungrouped speakers.

### Enhancements
- **No confirmation for destructive actions**: "Ungroup Selected" immediately dissolves groups without confirmation. Add dialog: "Ungroup X speakers? This cannot be undone." or add undo capability. (MenuBarContentView.swift:1262-1345) [Added by claudeCode]

### Architecture
- **God object: SonosController (1,412 lines)**: Violates Single Responsibility Principle. Mixes SSDP discovery, UPnP/SOAP communication, XML parsing, device management, group management, volume control, and network socket management. Split into separate services: DeviceDiscoveryService, GroupManagementService, VolumeControlService, SonosNetworkClient. (SonosController.swift) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Massive view controller: MenuBarContentView (1,602 lines)**: Business logic mixed with UI code. Implement MVVM pattern with MenuBarViewModel to separate concerns. Target ~300-400 lines per view controller. (MenuBarContentView.swift) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Raw network layer without abstraction**: SOAP XML constructed via string concatenation (error-prone). No request/response type safety, inconsistent error handling, no retry logic. Introduce type-safe SOAPRequest/SOAPResponse structs with proper error types. (SonosController.swift) [Added by claudeCode]

## P2 - Medium Priority

_Nice-to-have improvements that enhance UX or reduce technical debt._

### Features
- **Search/filter for speakers**: In large installations (10+ speakers), scrolling list becomes unwieldy. Add search field at top of speaker list. (MenuBarContentView.swift:276-378) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Volume presets**: Add quick volume buttons (25%, 50%, 75%) near slider for instant adjustment. Common pattern in TV remotes and audio apps. [Added by claudeCode]

### Enhancements
- **Network error handling improvements**: Network errors show one-time alert, but no way to retry discovery or diagnose issues after dismissal. Add "Refresh" button in Speakers section when no speakers found. (MenuBarContentView.swift:711-719) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Volume normalization when grouping**: Individual speaker volumes preserved when creating groups, which can result in unbalanced audio. Consider normalizing to average or coordinator volume. (SonosController.swift:937-998) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Group expand/collapse state persistence**: Expanded groups reset to collapsed when reopening popover. Persist `expandedGroups` Set to UserDefaults. (MenuBarContentView.swift:50) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Volume step size visibility**: Volume step configured in Preferences (1-20%) not shown in popover. Show "Â±5%" next to slider or in HUD. (PreferencesWindow.swift:84-102) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Stereo pair limitation warning**: When selecting stereo pair as coordinator, operation may fail (Sonos limitation). Warn before attempting or disable stereo pairs as group leaders in UI. (SonosController.swift:980-982) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Graceful degradation for slow networks**: 5s discovery timeout may miss devices on congested networks. Add progressive disclosure: "Discovering... Found 2 speakers, still searching..." with "Search Longer" button. (SonosController.swift:133-143) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Group/individual volume visual differentiation**: Group cards use subtle icon differences. Add colored left border (blue, 3pt) to groups for clearer distinction. (MenuBarContentView.swift:381-466) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Success feedback for grouping**: After grouping, popover refreshes but no explicit success confirmation. Show success HUD: "Group Created: [Name]" and auto-expand new group. (MenuBarContentView.swift:1419-1467) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Wrong device HUD clarity**: "Wrong audio device" message doesn't guide users to fix it. Change to "Switch to [Trigger Device] to use hotkeys" with current device shown. (VolumeKeyMonitor.swift) [Added by claudeCode]


- **Offline/unreachable speaker detection**: Offline speakers remain in list, controls fail silently. Detect timeouts, show "Offline" badge, auto-refresh topology every 60s. (SonosController.swift) [Added by claudeCode]

### Architecture
- **Now playing metadata refresh on user interactions**: Currently UI refreshes album art and metadata on volume slider changes, causing visual glitches during interaction. Should subscribe to UPnP RenderingControl events for metadata updates instead of refreshing on user clicks/slider changes. This would eliminate glitches and reduce unnecessary network calls. (MenuBarContentView.swift - volumeChanged, fetchNowPlayingInfo) [Added by claudeCode - Phase 2 technical debt]

- **Permission monitoring observer cleanup**: AppSettings tracks permission observers in array but never removes them, potential memory leak if components are deallocated. Add `removePermissionObserver()` method or use weak references. Also consider converting to Combine Publishers for better lifecycle management. (AppSettings.swift:233-240) [Added by claudeCode - Phase 1 technical debt]

- **VolumeKeyMonitor needs pause/resume for testing**: Test Hotkeys feature (Phase 2) requires temporarily disabling main event tap to avoid conflicts. Add `pause()` and `resume()` methods to VolumeKeyMonitor that disable/enable the event tap without full teardown. Store tap state to handle re-entrancy. (VolumeKeyMonitor.swift) [Added by claudeCode - Phase 2 requirement]

- **Remaining Sendable warnings in SonosController**: Multiple warnings for mutation of captured vars and non-Sendable completion handlers. Convert remaining completion handler callbacks to use `@Sendable` closures or pure async/await patterns. (SonosController.swift:461, 465, 476, 790, 926, 1075, 1213, 1266) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Inconsistent concurrency patterns**: Mix of callbacks, Tasks, DispatchQueue, DispatchSemaphore, Thread.sleep. Establish clear async/await strategy throughout codebase. [Added by claudeCode]

- **Poor error propagation**: Silent failures (print statements only). Introduce structured SonosError enum with LocalizedError conformance for proper user-facing error messages. [Added by claudeCode]

- **Tight coupling to frameworks**: Direct URLSession, Core Audio APIs in business logic. No dependency injection makes testing difficult. Add protocol abstractions (NetworkSession, AudioDeviceProvider). [Added by claudeCode]

## P3 - Low Priority

_Polish, minor improvements, and long-term architectural refactoring._

### Features
- **About window**: Add window showing version, changelog, support links. No current way to check version without quitting. [Added by claudeCode]

- **Settings import/export**: Users who reinstall or use multiple Macs can't transfer configuration. Add export/import for trigger device, hotkeys, default speaker. [Added by claudeCode]

- **Multi-room scene support**: Sonos supports scenes (predefined group+volume+source). Expose via quick-action buttons. [Added by claudeCode]

- **Sonos alarm management**: View or disable alarms from menu bar (common use case: turn off alarm after waking). [Added by claudeCode]

### Enhancements
- **Preferences keyboard shortcut**: Add standard Cmd+, to open Preferences. Add tooltip to gear icon showing shortcut. (main.swift) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Volume slider fine control**: Add modifier key support (Shift = 1% increments, Option = 5%) and show percentage tooltip while dragging. (MenuBarContentView.swift:1016-1022) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Hover states**: Add subtle background color change on hover for speaker cards and scale-up (1.02x) for buttons. (MenuBarContentView.swift) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Welcome banner dismissal**: Add close button (X) to banner and persist dismissal preference. (MenuBarContentView.swift:967-1006) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Empty state styling**: "No speakers found" is plain text. Add SF Symbol icon (`antenna.radiowaves.left.and.right.slash`) and helpful suggestion. (MenuBarContentView.swift:711-719) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Grouping button tooltips**: Disabled buttons show no hint about requirements. Add tooltip: "Select 2+ speakers to group". (MenuBarContentView.swift:317-336) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Volume HUD group context**: HUD doesn't indicate if controlling a group. Add group icon and member count: "Living Room + 2 speakers". (VolumeHUD.swift:103-187) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Haptic feedback**: Add NSHapticFeedbackManager for tactile responses on button clicks, volume min/max, group creation. [Added by claudeCode]

- **Console logging in production**: Extensive print() statements. Wrap in #if DEBUG or use os_log for production builds. [Added by claudeCode]

### Architecture
- **Deprecated String(cString:) usage**: Replace deprecated String(cString:) with String(decoding:as:UTF8.self) after null termination truncation. (SonosController.swift:1467) [Added by claudeCode]

- **Extract configuration constants**: Magic numbers and strings scattered throughout. Create SonosConstants enum for ports, timeouts, multicast addresses. [Added by claudeCode]

- **Missing protocol abstractions**: No protocol definitions for key components. Would benefit from dependency inversion for testing. [Added by claudeCode]

## Known Bugs

_Remaining bugs tracked separately from prioritized items above._

_(Moved to P0/P1 sections)_

## Known Limitations

- **Line-in audio lost when grouping with stereo pairs**: When a stereo pair is playing line-in audio and grouped with another speaker, the line-in audio stops because the non-stereo-pair becomes coordinator and line-in sources are device-specific (cannot be shared). Workaround: Manually set the stereo pair with line-in as the coordinator in the Sonos app, or use streaming sources instead of line-in when grouping.

## Recently Resolved

- **Now Playing display section** â ADDED (2025-10-04): Added dedicated now-playing display between playback controls and volume slider showing current track information with album art. Display adapts to audio source type (streaming, radio, line-in, TV) and updates in real-time via UPnP transport events. Section automatically hides when device is idle. (PR #55)

- **Speaker and group name text truncation** â FIXED (2025-10-04): Fixed issue where long group names were being cut off in the middle. Applied explicit trailing constraints, changed truncation from middle to tail (ellipsis at end), added tooltips showing full names on hover. Applies to all cards: group cards, speaker cards, member cards, and now-playing labels. (PR #55)

- **Dynamic popover height expansion** â IMPROVED (2025-10-04): Popover now expands vertically to show all speakers without internal scrolling (up to screen limit). Calculates maximum height based on available screen space. Better experience for users with 2-10 speakers while gracefully handling larger installations with scrolling only when needed. (PR #55)

- **Basic playback controls** â ADDED (2025-10-04): Implemented play/pause, previous, and next transport controls in menu bar UI. Controls intelligently adapt to audio source type: streaming content supports all controls, radio/line-in support play/pause only. Added radio detection as separate AudioSourceType to distinguish from skippable streaming content. Controls route to group coordinator when speaker is in a multi-speaker group. (PR #54)

- **Transport state updates not working for certain speakers** â FIXED (2025-10-04): Root cause was HTML-encoded XML in AVTransport LastChange events. Sonos sends transport state wrapped in `&lt;TransportState&gt;` entities rather than raw XML tags. Added HTML entity decoding (`&quot;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`) before XML parsing. Also fixed concurrency crash by wrapping NotificationCenter.post in MainActor.run. All speakers now receive real-time play/pause UI updates. (PR #53)
