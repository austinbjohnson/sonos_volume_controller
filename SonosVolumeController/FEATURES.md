## Future Ideas
- ultrathink on this, make it so i can group speakers easily, my default speaker as set in preferences should be the audio source when grouping other speakers. make sure to lookup 2025 office sonos documentation 09
- icon: we need to make the icon something better than S, can you make an SVG that looks like a sonos speaker? i have no idea what best practices are around this. avoid looking like the macos native volume control 
- BUG, the slider in the UI only changes one of the speakers, we need the slider to follow the exact same logic as the hotkeys so that a speaker pair or whatnot is controlled not just one within a pair
