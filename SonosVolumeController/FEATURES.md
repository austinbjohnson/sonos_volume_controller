# Feature Roadmap

## App Store Readiness
- [ ] Build as .app bundle
- [ ] Code signing
- [ ] Sandboxing configuration
- [ ] App Store submission

## Future Ideas
- make it so i can group speakers easily, my default speaker as set in preferences should be the audio source when grouping other speakers 
- BUG - fix custom keystroke, it isn't taking key combinations (ie i tried command+9 and it just took the key for "9")
- BUG -- the volume isn't controlling a group, it's just controlling ONE of the paired speakers in office, we need to fix this and make sure it's somewhere that it will be noticed as we make changes in the future so we don't revert
