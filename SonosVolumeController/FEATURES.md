# Feature Roadmap

## App Store Readiness
- [ ] Build as .app bundle
- [ ] Code signing
- [ ] Sandboxing configuration
- [ ] App Store submission

## Future Ideas
- make it so i can group speakers easily, my default speaker as set in preferences should be the audio source when grouping other speakers 
- BUG - fix custom keystroke, it isn't taking key combinations (ie i tried command+9 and it just took the key for "9")
