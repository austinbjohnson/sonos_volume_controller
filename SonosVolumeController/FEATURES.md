# Feature Roadmap

## App Store Readiness
- [ ] Build as .app bundle
- [ ] Code signing
- [ ] Sandboxing configuration
- [ ] App Store submission

## Future Ideas
- icon: we need to make the icon something better than S, can you make an SVG that looks like a sonos speaker? i have no idea what best practices are around this. avoid looking like the macos native volume control 
- icon: the quite icon in the popout is a power icon, i would prefer the image of the person leaving through a door since we are using the power icon for the enabled state of the app
- grouping speakers with default: ultrathink on this, make it so i can group speakers easily, my default speaker as set in preferences should be the audio source when grouping other speakers. make sure to lookup 2025 office sonos documentation 09
