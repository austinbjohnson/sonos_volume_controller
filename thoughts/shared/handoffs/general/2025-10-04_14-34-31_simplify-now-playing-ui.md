# Handoff: Simplify Now Playing UI - Album Art Consolidation

## Task(s)

### Planned ðŸŽ¯
**Primary Goal**: Simplify the menu bar UI by consolidating album art display to only the now-playing section, removing it from individual speaker/group cards in the speaker list.

**Current State**: 
- Just completed PR with now-playing display section between playback controls and volume slider (commits 8f7efd2, 0c1182a)
- Album art currently shows in BOTH the now-playing section AND in speaker/group cards
- Now-playing display not updating when switching between speakers (reported by user despite fix attempts)

**Planned Changes**:
1. Remove album art thumbnails from speaker/group cards in the speaker list
2. Keep album art display ONLY in the dedicated now-playing section at top
3. Continue caching album art in background for smooth/fast UX (keep `albumArtCache` and async loading)
4. Fix persistent issue where now-playing section doesn't update when user clicks different speakers/groups
5. Create this work on a NEW BRANCH (not feature/playback-controls)

**Rationale**: Cleaner, more focused UI. Album art in every card is visually cluttered. The dedicated now-playing section provides better context for "what's currently selected and playing."

## Learnings

### Current Implementation Details

1. **Album Art Caching System**:
   - `SonosController.swift:18` - `albumArtCache: NSCache<NSString, NSImage>` stores fetched album art
   - `SonosController.swift:1631-1654` - `fetchAlbumArt(url:)` async method fetches and caches
   - Cache key is the album art URL string
   - Works well, should be preserved

2. **Now-Playing Data Flow**:
   - `MenuBarContentView.swift:72` - `nowPlayingCache` stores transport state per device UUID
   - Cache structure: `[UUID: (state, sourceType, nowPlaying)]`
   - `updateNowPlayingDisplay()` reads from both `nowPlayingCache` and `cachedSelectedDevice`
   - **Issue**: Despite adding update calls to selection handlers, user reports it still doesn't update

3. **Album Art Display Locations** (Current):
   - **Now-playing section** (lines 456-531): 44x44pt, 6pt corner radius, between playback controls and volume
   - **Speaker/group cards** (via `addNowPlayingLabel()`): 40x40pt thumbnails at leading edge
   - **Group cards specifically** (lines 970-1016): Pre-populate from cache during card creation

4. **Layout Considerations**:
   - Group cards: icon(8) + width(20) + spacing(10) + [albumArt(40) + spacing(16)] + nameLabel
   - When album art removed, nameLabel should move from 94pt to 38pt leading position
   - Card height is fixed at 42pt, won't need adjustment

5. **Update Timing Issue**:
   - User reports now-playing section still doesn't update when clicking speakers
   - Already added `updateNowPlayingDisplay()` to both `selectSpeaker()` (line 2333, 2341) and `selectGroup()` (line 2431)
   - Possible causes:
     - Async timing: `getAudioSourceInfo()` call may not complete before UI updates
     - Cache not being populated for newly selected device
     - `updateNowPlayingDisplay()` reading stale `cachedSelectedDevice` before async update completes
     - Need to pass device info directly or ensure proper sequencing

## Action Items & Next Steps

### 0. **URGENT: Create PR for Current Work (feature/playback-controls)**

The work from the previous session has been committed and pushed but **NO PR EXISTS YET**. Before starting the UI simplification work, create a PR:

**Branch**: `feature/playback-controls`  
**Commits**: 8f7efd2, 0c1182a, 80a7194 (and earlier playback control commits)

**PR Title**: `Feature: Now Playing display and UI/UX improvements`

**PR Description**:
```markdown
## Summary
Adds dedicated now-playing display section and improves overall UI/UX with three key enhancements:

1. **Now Playing Display** - Shows current track with 44x44pt album art between playback controls and volume slider
2. **Text Truncation Fixes** - Fixed group/speaker names being cut off (e.g., "athroom + Bedroom" now shows "Bathroom + Bedroom")
3. **Dynamic Height Expansion** - Popover expands to show all speakers without internal scrolling (up to screen limit)

## Changes

### Added
- Now-playing section with album art, track title, and artist
- Real-time updates via transport state notifications
- Adaptive display for all source types (streaming, radio, line-in, TV, idle)
- Auto-hide when device is idle

### Fixed
- Group and speaker card text truncation with proper trailing constraints
- Changed truncation mode from middle to tail (ellipsis at end)
- Added tooltips showing full names on hover
- Now-playing display updates when switching speakers/groups

### Improved
- Dynamic popover height based on screen size (450-700pt typical)
- Better experience for 2-10 speaker setups
- Scrolling only when needed (15+ speakers on small screens)

## Documentation
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with all changes
- Updated ROADMAP.md moving completed items to "Recently Resolved"
- Added P1 feature for intelligent grouping with audio source selection

## Testing
Manually tested with:
- [x] Multiple speakers playing different sources
- [x] Group creation and selection
- [x] Line-in, Radio, Streaming, TV sources
- [x] Text truncation with long group names
- [x] Dynamic height with varying speaker counts

## Closes
- Addresses text truncation issues from user feedback
- Implements now-playing display feature
- Improves popover UX for users with multiple speakers
```

**After creating PR**: Update CHANGELOG.md to replace `(PR #XX)` with actual PR number in all three entries (lines 11, 40, 49).

### 1. Create New Branch for UI Simplification
```bash
# After PR is created, branch off from feature/playback-controls
git checkout feature/playback-controls
git checkout -b feature/simplify-now-playing-ui
```

### 2. Remove Album Art from Speaker/Group Cards

**In `MenuBarContentView.swift`**:

a) **Remove album art from `createGroupCard()`** (lines 970-1016):
   - Remove the now-playing cache check and `addNowPlayingLabel()` calls
   - Remove the `hasNowPlayingContent` check
   - Set nameLabel leading back to simple: `icon(8) + width(20) + spacing(10) = 38pt` always
   - Keep the now-playing text label if desired (just without album art)

b) **Remove album art from `createSpeakerCard()`**:
   - Find where `addNowPlayingLabel()` is called for speaker cards
   - Remove album art display but keep metadata text if needed
   - Simplify layout constraints

c) **Refactor `addNowPlayingLabel()`**:
   - Option 1: Remove method entirely if no longer needed
   - Option 2: Keep for text-only metadata display on cards
   - Remove all calls to `addAlbumArtImage()` from this method

d) **Remove `addAlbumArtImage()` method** (lines 1568-1690):
   - No longer needed if album art only in now-playing section
   - Or refactor to be now-playing section specific

### 3. Update CHANGELOG After PR Creation

Once PR is created and you have the PR number:
```bash
# Replace PR #XX with actual number in CHANGELOG.md
# Lines 11, 40, 49 all have (PR #XX) placeholders
```

### 4. Fix Now-Playing Section Update Issue

**Root cause investigation needed**:
- The `updateNowPlayingDisplay()` is being called but not reflecting changes
- Check if `cachedSelectedDevice` is updating synchronously after `selectDevice()`
- Verify `nowPlayingCache` is being populated before `updateNowPlayingDisplay()` reads it

**Potential fixes**:
- Move `updateNowPlayingDisplay()` call to AFTER `getAudioSourceInfo()` completes AND cache is updated
- Pass device info directly to `updateNowPlayingDisplay()` instead of reading from cache
- Add explicit cache update before calling display update
- Consider adding a small delay or using Task.yield() to ensure state is synchronized

**Current flow to fix** (in `selectSpeaker()`):
```
1. selectDevice(name) - async
2. getAudioSourceInfo(device) - async  
3. Update cache with sourceInfo
4. Call updateNowPlayingDisplay() <- may read stale cache
```

Should be:
```
1. selectDevice(name) - async
2. getAudioSourceInfo(device) - async
3. Update nowPlayingCache[device.uuid] with sourceInfo
4. THEN call updateNowPlayingDisplay() - reads fresh cache
```

### 5. Test Thoroughly

**Test Cases**:
- [ ] Select speaker playing Spotify â†’ now-playing shows album art, cards have no album art
- [ ] Select speaker playing radio â†’ now-playing shows radio icon, cards have no album art
- [ ] Select idle speaker â†’ now-playing hides, cards remain clean
- [ ] Switch between different speakers â†’ now-playing updates immediately each time
- [ ] Switch between group and individual speaker â†’ updates correctly
- [ ] Group speakers while one is playing â†’ now-playing shows coordinator's content
- [ ] Performance: Album art loads smoothly in now-playing section (cache working)
- [ ] Visual: Speaker list looks cleaner without album art thumbnails

### 6. Update Documentation

- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with UI simplification changes
- No ROADMAP changes needed (this is cleanup/refinement)
- Update PR description to explain the UX decision

## Other Notes

### File References

**Now-Playing Section** (keep album art here):
- `MenuBarContentView.swift:456-531` - Section setup
- `MenuBarContentView.swift:533-691` - Update logic
- `MenuBarContentView.swift:630-691` - Album art helper methods

**Speaker/Group Cards** (remove album art):
- `MenuBarContentView.swift:907-1019` - `createGroupCard()`
- `MenuBarContentView.swift:1087-1250` - `createSpeakerCard()`
- `MenuBarContentView.swift:1021-1085` - `createMemberCard()`
- `MenuBarContentView.swift:1289-1330` - `populateSpeakers()` - may need layout adjustments

**Album Art Infrastructure** (preserve):
- `SonosController.swift:18` - `albumArtCache` NSCache
- `SonosController.swift:1631-1654` - `fetchAlbumArt()` method
- Keep these for performance, just change WHERE art is displayed

### Design Decision Rationale

**Why consolidate album art?**
1. **Cleaner UI**: Less visual clutter in speaker list
2. **Better focus**: Album art in now-playing section has more context (it's what YOU are controlling right now)
3. **Performance**: Fewer image views to render and update
4. **Consistency**: One source of truth for "what's playing on selected device"
5. **Mobile-friendly**: Matches typical music app patterns (list of tracks/devices with single large album art)

**What to preserve:**
- Text metadata in cards (track/artist names) - still useful for glanceable info
- Source badges (green/blue/teal dots) - quick visual indicators
- Album art caching system - essential for smooth UX
- Now-playing display functionality - this is the star of the show

### Build Commands
```bash
cd SonosVolumeController
pkill SonosVolumeController
swift run
```

### Branch Strategy
- Base new branch off current `feature/playback-controls` 
- Or merge feature/playback-controls to main first, then branch from main
- Keep changes atomic and focused on UI simplification
